All questions must be answered based on the project technologies:
- The /api repository is in Laravel version 12, using the PostgreSQL database.
- The /front repository is in Vue 3, using Typescript and the Vuetify component library. All screens must use Vuetify components and classes, always focusing on the most appropriate component for the request.

When using an example file, always give its default path, the same must be done when creating new files.
